This is a project on singly linked lists

Singly Linked List in C is one of the simplest linear data structures, that we use for storing our data in an easy and efficient way.  Linked List in C comprises nodes like structures, which can further be divided into 2 parts in the case of a singly linked list. These two parts are-:

Node – for storing the data.
Pointer – for storing the address of the next node
